# Zumo-Pico-Wifi-
Built & coded the Raspberry Pi Pico W: WiFi Controlled Robot shown on
Explaining Computers https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTo4Qh2R6m4, first making it on a breadboard & then making some changes.
Replaced the L298N motor board with the more efficient TB6612FNG.
Changed the code to include speed control, primarily to slow the turns and add timing
to make 90 degree turns.
Added an led & coding to indicate when the robot is connected to the server.
Added some styling to improve the appearance of the Control & to include some more
buttons for future addition of programable leds
